README  --  Bouncing Ball	

This is a simple 1D simulator for a bouncing ball. It uses symplectic euler integration with simple event detection. The output is a .csv file with three columns: time, position, velocity. There is a matlab script to plot the data, as well as a python script. The python script requires SciPi (http://www.scipy.org/install.html). For now, all parameters have been hard-coded to make it easier to read and understand the source code.

Compile code: ./make
Run code:  ./BouncingBall_1D
