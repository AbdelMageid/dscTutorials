pwPoly5 = PieceWise POLYnomial 5th-order 

This library is designed to be used for approximating functions where the
interpolant must have a continuous second derivative (eg. optimization). 

Functions are provided for fitting data sets (periodic and not), and 
interpolating the result. 

A few demonstrations (DEMO_*.m) are provided to show how to use the program
