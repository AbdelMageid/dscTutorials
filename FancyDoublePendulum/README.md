Fancy Double Pendulum

================================

System of three point masses, connected by force and torque actuators. Simple PD control law can be inserted to turn into a spring-mass-damper system in 2D.

There are two versions
 - Polar - State is angles and distances
 - Cartesian - State is a set of (x,y) coordinates
