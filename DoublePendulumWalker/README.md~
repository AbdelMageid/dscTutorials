Double Pendulum Walker  --  Trajectory Optimization	

===================================================

This code runs a trajectory optimization using GPOPS2 to find an optimal periodic walking trajectory for the double pendulum model of walking: point mass at the hip and at the swing foot, ankle actuator, hip actuator, and push-off impulse.

Run: MAIN.m

The dynamics were derived automatically (code not included)
